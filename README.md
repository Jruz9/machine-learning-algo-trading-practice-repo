# Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading Practice
<!-- TODO: COmplete the readme in the new format used in other projects -->
## About
This is a repository that shows the coding practice from the example of the book algorithmic trading with machine learning .

It will be divided into chapters with clear titles of what is being done and in the future the reader will include things needed from other chapters since there are lots of reused items for other places in the chapter implementation.

Additionally a chapter explainer will be included just for myself to remember if i relook things at.


## Inspiration

The inspiration for this comes from my interest in the financial markets and my experience in using machine learning programming. 
I wanted to learn more about how it is done and learn more of the programming process and the mathematics that could be used.
My goal is to learn more about algorithmic programming and use the teaching in a simulated system that can i can play in like using alpaca and other third party stock market api systems for simulated training.



## Getting Started (In future will probably be converted to use uv for better ease of use)
- virtualenv venv (windows)
  - python3 -m venv venv (mac os and linux)source venv_name/bin/activate (mac and linux)
    - .\venv_name/bin/activate (Windows) or  source venv_name/bin/activate (mac and linux)
  - Making requirement files
    - pip freeze > requirements.txt
  - Installing packages:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
